* A Link to the app can be found [here](https://vast-harbor-82927.herokuapp.com/)

* In this app, the user can search for articles from the New York Times

* The user must input a topic, a start year and an end year for parameters

* When the user clicks "Search", the API is run and articles are returned into the "Results" panel.

* The results are also saved into a database.

* The results include a headline title and a link to the article, which would open in another tab if clicked

* If the user would like to save the articles, they must click on "Save" and the articles will show up in the "Saved Articles" Panel

**Future Plans**

* When the user clicks on a saved article they can add a note to it, which is then saved into a corresponding database
